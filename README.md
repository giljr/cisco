Hi, this is all about [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/),
Cisco Lab Activities - Cisco Packet Tracer Labs:):rocket:


```

Cisco is the  
major network vendor  
            out there!

```
Products in this category are Cisco's range of routers, switches, 
wireless systems, security systems, WAN acceleration hardware, 
energy and building management systems and media aware network equipment. 
unified computing, unified fabric, data centre switching, 
storage networking and cloud computing services.

[Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) is an exciting network design, 
simulation and modelling tool that allows you to 
develop your skill set in networking, cybersecurity, 
and the Internet of Things (IoT)\o/. It allows you to model 
complex systems without the need for dedicated equipment. 

It is used across numerous [Cisco Academy](https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_sg/partners/cisco-networking-academy/index.html) courses to help develop 
and assess the skill set necessary for successful completion of the course.

In this repo we offer our Cisco Labs in this incredible tool, [Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer),
and we will, as we learned network, save all these laboratories to share with the 
Cisco Community in a step by step fashion, incrementally, as far as we can reach 
and levarage our learning process, from the very beginning skill:)
