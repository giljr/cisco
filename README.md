Cisco Lab Activities - Cisco Packet Tracer Labs:):rocket:

     Cisco is the  
major vendor network 
   outhere!

Products in this category are Cisco's range of routers, switches, 
wireless systems, security systems, WAN acceleration hardware, 
energy and building management systems and media aware network equipment. 
unified computing, unified fabric, data centre switching,

Packet Tracer is an exciting network design, 
simulation and modelling tool that allows you to 
develop your skill set in networking, cybersecurity, 
and the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows you to model 
complex systems without the need for dedicated equipment. 

It is used across numerous Cisco Academy courses to help develop 
and assess the skill set necessary for successful completion of the course.

In this repo we offer our laboratories in this incredible tool, Packet Tracer,
and we will, as we learned, save all the laboratories to share with the
